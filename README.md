Python Server CubieTruck
========================

This is simple project for my home cubietruck based debian to run and monitor some installed service which need to be pushed 
start up.

This also monitors my torrent application "Transmission-Daemon" on this server and notify in email about the current downloads
and completed status.

I trying to grow this project into a robust implementation for some re-usable features.
